						 Function Constructures

		Inheritance: One Object gets access to the properties
								 and methods of another object

		Prototypal using . 
									 see picture

		ES6 uses class

								(new is the keyword)
		The 'this' variable points a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.
